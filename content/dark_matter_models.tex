\add{Most of the DM halo models in the literature are phenomenological, i.e. motivated by the phenomenology of rotation curves either from observations or from numerical N-body simulations. In contrast, we consider a fermionic DM model based on first physical principles including statistical-mechanics and thermodynamics.}
