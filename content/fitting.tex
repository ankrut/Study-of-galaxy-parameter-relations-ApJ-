\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:fitting}
This work uses the new Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (\href{http://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/}{SPARC}) database. It includes 3.6$\micron$ near-infrared and 21 cm observations. The former traces the stellar distribution (bulge and disk) while the latter traces the atomic gas distribution and provides velocity fields from which the rotation curves are derived. See \citet{2016AJ....152..157L} for a complete description of the SPARC database.
