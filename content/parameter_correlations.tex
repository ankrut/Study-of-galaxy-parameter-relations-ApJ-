We analyze different pairs of structural galaxy parameters, obtained from core-halo best-fit solutions of the fermionic model for a particle mass of $\SI{50}{\kilo\eV}$. Of interest are values at the core such as the core mass $M_c = M(r_c)$ and at the halo such as the halo radius $r_h$ and halo mass $M_h = M(r_h)$. The core radius $r_c$ is defined at the first maximum in the rotation curve and the halo radius $r_h$ is defined at the second maximum.

% boundary mass definition
Further, we are also interested in the total DM mass $M_{\rm tot}$ what requires a careful definition here. Usually, mass distributions infinite in mass and space are truncated for example at a critical radius or density to obtain reasonable values. In that fashion, we define the \textit{boundary mass} $M_b = M(r_b)$, being $r_b$ the boundary radius where the density falls to the critical density of the Local Group (about $\SI{E-5}{\Msun\per\parsec^3}$).

% surface mass definition
On contrary, fermionic DM exposed to particle escaping (i.e. evaporation) provides naturally finite mass distributions. Thus, we define the \textit{surface mass} $M_s = M(r_s)$, being $r_s$ the natural surface radius where the density falls to zero. For a large escape of particles ($W_p \ll 10$) we have total masses $M_b \approx M_s$ while for a negligible escape of particles ($W_p \gg 10$) the mass distribution grows in extent and the boundary radius must be imposed such that $M_b \ll M_s$.

% obtained galaxy parameter range
Regarding the halo, we obtain the radii mainly in the interval $[10^3,10^5]\si{\parsec}$ and masses in the interval $[10^8,10^{12}] \si{\Msun}$. As shown in \cref{fig:parameter-correlction:core-halo} the halo radius and mass follow a clear relation described by \begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:rel:Mh-rh}
	\ln \qbracket{\frac{M_h}{M_\odot}} \approx 2\ln \qbracket{\frac{r_h}{\mathrm{pc}}} + 5.8 \pm 1.7
\end{equation} Interestingly, this relation is independent of particle escape, i.e it holds for solutions with an isothermal-like halo developing a flat tail as well as for polytropic non-isothermal halos implying a large escape of particles.
