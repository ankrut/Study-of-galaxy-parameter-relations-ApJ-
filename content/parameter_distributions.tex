We analyse the distribution of configuration parameters which affect the shape of the DM RC for each DM model. The scaling parameters (e.g. $R_{\rm N}$ or $\rho_{\rm N}$) do not show any insights. Therefore, on this basis, we are interested only in fermionic, DC14 and Einasto models, which are the only ones where the halo slopes (usually characterized by $\gamma$) depend on one configuration parameter.

Starting with the core-halo solutions, see upper plots in \cref{fig:parameter-distribution:mepp}, we find that the majority of central temperature values falls in the range $\beta_0 \in [\num{E-8}, \num{E-6}]$ corresponding to solutions in which the central DM cores are far from reaching the core-collapse towards a SMBH \citep{2019PDU....24..278A,2021MNRAS.502.4227A}. The distribution of the central degeneracy values looks like a Gaussian with the mean value at about 36, far in the degenerate regime $\theta_0 \gtrsim 10$. The majority is in the range $\theta_0 \in [30, 40]$. A similar distribution pattern is given for $W_0$. However, for core-halo solutions (i.e. $\theta_0 \gtrsim 10$) it is better to look at the plateau cutoff $W_p$ which can be identified with $W_0$ of a corresponding halo-only solution.

The plateau of a core-halo solution acts as a connection between the halo and the embedded core. Therefore, every core-halo solution of the fermionic model has a corresponding halo-only solution describing the diluted halo without the embedded, degenerate core. The corresponding values for such halo-only solutions are given at the plateau which resemble the inner halo, see lower plots in \cref{fig:parameter-distribution:mepp}. The plateau temperature shows a very similar distribution due to the tiny temperature changes when in the low temperature regime ($\beta_0 \ll \num{E-4}$) where pressure effects are negligible leading to $\beta_p \approx \beta_0$. The plateau degeneracy distribution looks also similar to the central degeneracy but being mirrored and shifted to the negative (diluted) regime. We find the relation $\theta_p \approx -0.7 \theta_0 - 1.2$.

Of great interest is the plateau cutoff $W_p$ which is a proxy for the central cutoff $W_0$ parameter and provides better insights about the halo shape. The plateau cutoff describes the particle escape intensity on halo scales and is defined as $W_p = W(r_p)$ with the plateau radius $r_p$ located at the first minimum in the DM RC. The lower $W_p$ the more truncated is the halo due to evaporation. See also section \ref{sec:morph} for a discussion about the halo morphology and comparison with other DM models.

Within the fermionic model we identify two groups in the $W_p$ distribution of core-halo solutions and $W_0$ distribution of halo-only solution, respectively: (1) an isothermal (non-truncated) group with 76 galaxies and (2) a non-isothermal (truncated) group with 44 galaxies. Both groups are divided at about $W_p \approx 10$ (core-halo) and $W_0 \approx 10$ (halo-only), respectively.

For the first group the outer halo seems to be isothermal (i.e. characterized by a flat tail and $\rho(r) \propto r^{-2}$ for large enough $r$). However, for those galaxies the exact value of $W_0$ cannot be determined due to insufficient and/or too limited information in the outer halo data, and thus they are not shown in \cref{fig:parameter-distribution:mepp}. In contrast, the second group seems to have a broader data coverage and/or admitting for a cleaner description of the outer RC, allowing for a better constrain of the outer halo of the fermionic DM profiles (i.e. with finite $W_p \lesssim 10$ and consequent non-isothermal halo tails). See \cref{fig:halo-profiles} for a comparison between typical solution of both groups.

In the case of halo-only solutions (i.e. $\theta_0 \lesssim -5)$ there is an interesting accumulation of galaxies around the particular value of $W_0 \approx 7.45$, see dashed line in \cref{fig:parameter-distribution:mepp}. This particular value reflects the point of stability change where the diluted solutions become unstable, i.e. for $W_0 \gtrsim 7.45$ \citep{2015PhRvD..91f3531C}, and may indicate physical insights into galaxy formation. Interestingly, for this value of $W_0$, the density profile of the classical King model resembles the Burkert profile (see \ref{sec:morph}). Nevertheless, keep in mind that already for $W_0 \gtrsim 10$ data does not allow to safely determine the central cutoff $W_0$.

In the case of the DC14 model \add{the majority of best-fitted $X$ values is in the range $[-5, 0]$ with a peak at the median of $X \approx -2.4$ as indicated by the boxplot in \cref{fig:parameter-distribution:dc14}. The crosses may be outliers.} When we calculate the parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ with \cref{eqn:dc14:alpha,eqn:dc14:beta,eqn:dc14:gamma}, there seems to be a grouping in the distribution of $\alpha$ with a separation at $\alpha = 0$, see \cref{fig:parameter-distribution:dc14}. However, \cref{eqn:hernquist} is not defined for $\alpha = 0$. Phenomenologically, $\alpha$ describes the transition from the inner to the outer halo. The larger $\abs{\alpha}$ the more extended is the transition, characterized by a long wide maximum. $\beta$ describes the slope in the outer halo while $\gamma$ describes the slope in the inner halo. For $\gamma = 0$ the DM profiles become cored.

The Einasto model has only a single configuration parameter $\alpha$ describing the transition from the cored inner halo to the outer halo with $v \sim r^{-2}$ due the the finite total mass. The larger $\alpha$ the less extended is the RC maximum (this is opposite to the DC14 model). As shown in \cref{fig:parameter-distribution:einasto} the majority has $\alpha < 1$ that corresponds to a rather extended RC maximum. This distribution represents well the majority of SPARC galaxies showing an extended outer halo trend without a clear maximum in the outer RC.
