\section{Fermionic halos}
\label{sec:fermionic-halos}
\add{This section is mainly devoted to fermionic halos where we include the analysis of the DM surface density relation (SDR), originally based on the Burkert model. Further, we highlight the rich morphology of fermionic DM halos and show that particular solutions can be associated with different DM models. As typical examples, we present detailed rotation curve fits and their corresponding analysis for three selected galaxies indicating the limitations of the observational data and/or the case where data supports for one clear maximum in the rotation curve of each DM model.}
