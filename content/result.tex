After an insightful analysis of the parameter distribution of each DM model which best fits the SPARC RCs (given in appendix \ref{sec:appendix:parameter-distribution}), we compare between them following two complementary approaches.

First, we consider the entire galaxy sample and extract the radial acceleration information for the total and baryonic components at each galactocentric radii, and put them all together as in \cref{fig:acceleration:grid} (SPARC-window). In this way, we reduce any characteristics of individual galaxies into an overall (\textit{global}) picture, i.e. the Radial Acceleration Relation \citep{2016PhRvL.117t1101M} and Mass Discrepancy Acceleration Relation \citep{2004ApJ...609..652M,2014Galax...2..601M}, respectively.

In the second approach, we consider each \textit{individual} galaxy and perform a goodness of DM-model analysis, showing how well the inferred DM RCs are fitted by these models. As typical examples, we show in \cref{fig:benchmark:total-rotation-curves} detailed rotation curve fit analyses for three selected galaxies indicating the limitations of the observational data and/or the case where data supports for one clear maximum in the rotation curve of each DM model.
