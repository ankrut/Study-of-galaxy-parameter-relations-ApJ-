Here, we reproduce the radial acceleration correlation and perform a goodness of model analysis for our RAR model as well as for NFW and DC14. We demonstrate that the acceleration behavior for individual galaxies is more intricate what becomes obvious after changing the perspective of the acceleration correlation. Finally, we present correlations for different pairs of structural galaxy parameter.
