	\caption{Illustrations of DM models: density profile (top) and rotation curve (bottom). Shown are typical configuration parameters as obtained from this work and detailed in section \ref{sec:appendix:parameter-distribution}. The core-halo solution of the fermionic DM model is illustrated by the configuration parameters $\beta_0 = \num{E-7}$, $\theta_0 = 30$ and $W_0 = 60$, in combination with a corresponding halo-only solution. For comparison, other DM models (NEW, DC14, Burkert, Einasto) are added. All profiles are normalized with respect to the halo radius $r_h$, defined at the halo velocity maximum, with $\rho_h = r(r_h)$ and $v_h = v(r_h)$.}%
